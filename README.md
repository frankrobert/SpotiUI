# SpotiUI

### Recreating the Spotify UI and functionality

> React, Redux, React-Router, Express

## Start
*  install node v8.9.0 or `nvm use`
*  `npm i`
*  `npm start`

## Motivation
I wanted to practice CSS, Express as well as try out new ways to organize Redux actions and reducers.

## Progress and TODO List:
* Left-hand Nav
  * Playlists [x]
  * Add New Playlist [x] (UI is good, missing part of the endpoint)
  * Browser []
  * Radio
* Auth [x]
* Get User Info [x]
* Everything else... []
